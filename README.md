# Impact-of-Covid-19-in-India
The aim of this data visualization project is to analyze and visualize Covid-19 data in India using techniques and tools like Power BI. 

# Key features
•	The project specifies key attributes for analysis, including death rate (ratio of deaths to the population), confirmed cases (individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2), recovered cases (patients medically recovered from Covid-19), and state-wise data (number of infected people in each Indian state).<br>
•	Different visualization techniques such as pie charts, bar graphs, line graphs, and map visualizations are identified to present the data effectively. These techniques will help in conveying complex information in a visually appealing manner.<br>
•	The project concludes by reaffirming the effectiveness of tools like Power BI for visualizing India-specific Covid-19 data. Its role in transforming complex Indian pandemic data into actionable insights is crucial for understanding and mitigating the challenges posed by Covid-19 in India.<br>
